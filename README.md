# Prolog-Degree-Requirements-Project
Query Courses and Graduation Requirements using Prolog
Created for CPSC 312 2019W1 at UBC by James Drayton Beninger, Jeffrey Wang, and Rui Wang (https://wiki.ubc.ca/DegreeLog)

What was the problem?
At the time of creation, UBC Degree Navigator was difficult to use and did not clearly indicate what requirements a student did or did not meet. DegreeLog will allow
users to make clear and intuitive queries regarding their degree progress. Using a Faculty of Science degree majoring in Computer Science as a reference demonstrating
that it could be done in general, we used Prolog to create a knowledge base and functions that can be used to what degree requirements must be met for the student to
graduate as intended.
